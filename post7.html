                    <p>OTT stands for “Over The Top” and refers to any streaming service that
                        delivers content over the internet. The service is delivered “over the top” of
                        another platform, hence the moniker.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are a large number of OTT platforms working in India such as Netflix,
                        Amazon Prime, Hotstar, Voot, Disney+, etc. Unlike the content provided by
                        cinema or television that is regulated by Central Board of Film Certification
                        (CBFC), Broadcasting Content Complaints Cell (BCCC), etc., the OTT
                        platforms have no regulatory body over them to control the content streamed,
                        and consequently enjoy their freedom.  
                    </p>
                    <p>The entertainment industry hit to the bottom in the year 2020 with theaters
                        shutting down and film shoots coming to a standstill in the wake of COVID-19
                        pandemic. With no alternative source of entertainment in contention, OTT
                        platforms gained an unprecedented viewership. For viewers, it means that the
                        possible viewing platforms constantly change and evolve to provide the best
                        possible user experience. Part of what makes subscriptions like Netflix so
                        popular is their lack of commercials, saving viewers from show interruptions
                        and time wasted watching commercials instead of the actual show. More
                        shows, more availability, and access to the content anywhere- sounds like a
                        pretty good deal . It features many genres varying from crime-thrillers to
                        romantics-melodramas and fantasies, and much more!   
                    </p>
                    <p>But as the content viewing shifted from being a communalised viewing on a
                        50” television screen to a personalized viewing on a 5” mobile screen, the
                        nature of content changed as well. With no restrictions over streaming
                        content, makers enjoy the freedom and include graphics and language that
                        they would otherwise avoid fearing the rejection by Censor board as well as
                        the public opinion and revolt.
                    </p>
                    <p>With so much content being produced and added to streaming platforms every
                        day, there has been a growing issue about content censorship across the
                        world. The government is gearing up to introduce broad content guidelines for
                        over the top (OTT) media services as controversy rages on putting under
                        spotlight the self-regulation versus censorship debate once again. The
                        Information and Broadcast Ministry of India is proposing that OTT platforms
                        fall under its purview so that they can be regulated just as other media such
                        as TV, radio, films, etc. On 11th November 2020, the Central government
                        issued a notification which stated that OTT (Over The Top) platforms and
                        online news portals will come under ‘Information & Broadcasting (I&B)
                        ministry’. India is planning to draft and legislate an overarching statute for OTT
                        platforms and news websites that will define a framework for their
                        self-regulation, and address the issues of sensitive content and fake news -a
                        move that is aimed at creating a level playing field in the business.
                        Patal Lok on Netflix in India has been surrounded by controversy because of
                        violence, sexual content and portrayal of the hypocrisy of upper caste men.
                        Shows like ‘Mirzapur’ which indulges in the debauchery of women, and
                        ‘Tandav’ which hurts religious sentiments of people; have also caught a lot of
                        heat. ‘The Family Man’ also faced controversy as RSS' mouthpiece
                        Panchjanya, called the series 'Anti-Indian', 'Anti-Hindu', ‘pro-terror’. Netflix’s
                        ‘Sacred Games’ and ‘A Suitable Boy’ have both come under fire from various
                        groups.
                        </p>
                    <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">What this means for us? </h2> -->
                    <p>Due to unlimited access to any content on these platforms, children are being
                        exposed to content not suitable for their age which is harming their values and
                        culture. Moreover, increasing exhibition of sedentary culture has created
                        stereotyping of lifestyle amongst millennials which has increased peer
                        pressure.
                        </p>
                        <p>In a recent report by The Central Board of Film Certification, it has been found
                            that the casual usage of sex and vulgar language in such web series is a bait
                            to attract the audience. It thereby creates a bad influence on society.
                            On the other end, some of the content creators on online platforms believe
                            that censorship will tarnish the originality of the story. Also, some of the
                            previous experts who commented on previous legislation related to censorship
                            believe that censorship has no space in a mature democracy and as per facts,
                            India is the largest democracy in the world. People are preferring OTT content
                            over television content, because of the quality of content. But if it is censored,
                            the content may stoop to the same level as television content. This may
                            discourage investment in OTT platforms. OTT platforms created many
                            employment opportunities, and lack of investment may reverse the progress.
                            Currently, all major streaming players are following their own standards. Many
                            hold the opinion as: Streaming content should ideally follow the food industry
                            model, meaning series/ movies should have full disclosures about its contents
                            and allow the consumer to decide if they want to purchase or watch it .
                            All the while people are also voicing: “There should be no censorship,
                            self-regulation works all over the world. Let people decide what they want to
                            watch. If 18-year-olds can vote to decide India's next Prime Minister, they will
                            surely know what to watch on OTT.”
