                    <p>“WhatsApp the number to me”
                    </p>
                    <p>“WhatsApp the details please”
                    </p>
                    <p>“WhatsApp those files”
                    </p>
                    <p>“WhatsApp the pictures, ASAP”
                    </p>
                    <p>In the last decade, the word WhatsApp has been used synonymously with ‘converse’. The ease with which we can interact with people from all over the world has certainly justified the phrase ‘it’s a small world.’
                        </p>
                    <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">What this means for us? </h2> -->
                    <p>The recent concerns with privacy policy have caused an uproar. According to the new rules, WhatsApp can now store and share data like IP addresses, language, Time Zone with its parent company Facebook. Wait! The list does not end here, even your phone’s battery level, signal strength, and the internet service provider will be shared with Facebook. Moreover, the data collected may be used for better ad targeting.
                        </p>
                        <p>The tweaks in the privacy policy are mostly concerning business accounts. It is concerning when WhatsApp can collect information about the way you chat with a business account to show you ads. Moreover, these chats can be stored for internal review purposes as well. The level of integration between Facebook and Instagram was never unknown. With the recent updates, we are about to witness an integration between WhatsApp and Facebook as well. Don’t be surprised to see an ad about a product after interacting with a business account about it!
                        </p>
                        <p>From the perspective of users, the concerns are justified. This can be attributed to the poor way in which the updates had been rolled out initially. It was until much later that WhatsApp employed ‘statuses’ to illustrate the privacy of personal chats and extended the date of updating the policy. This gives the users time to process and fully understand the updates. Moreover, users in India and the USA have been eyeing the stricter privacy policy in the EU where the new update is not applicable.
                        </p>
                        <p>Now let’s flip the coin. Time and again, WhatsApp has made it clear that the personal chats are safe and have been end-end encrypted. The messages sent by a user to another will be stored in Whatsapp’s servers. Even data such as call logs, contacts, and your WhatsApp groups remain private and have not been shared with Facebook. Apart from that, certain basic (user) data collected is being collected to improve user experience and for providing better services.
                        </p>
                        <p>As for chats with business accounts, come to think of it, messaging a business is much different than messaging your relatives, friends, etc. Businesses often use 3rd party services to handle their WhatsApp and interact with customers. In this case, your messages can be accessed by the 3rd party vendor, even Facebook in this case (only if it the vendor). Such chats are not end-end encrypted.
                        </p>
                        <p>Lastly, WhatsApp ensures ‘safety, security, and integrity’. To uphold this statement, banner ads are not present on the platform which makes the users interact with their connections securely without any interferences.
                        </p>
