                    <p>In November 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won the presidential race against President Donald Trump.
                        The USA, being a global superpower, has the immense capacity to influence trade and commerce, as
                        well as foreign relations policies of several other countries. Among the many world leaders who
                        have recognised Biden as the winner, is the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
                    </p>
                    <p>With his win, Biden plans to fulfil his long-standing dream of uniting the two “natural partners”
                        – India and the USA. So, let us take a closer look at what the future looks like.
                    </p>
                    <p>Straight off the hook, the first thing that comes to mind is trade and commerce. President-elect
                        Joe Biden will work toward increasing and pushing bilateral trade through expert-driven,
                        institutional reforms. Another area of massive significance is defence. Biden will push for
                        India’s defence capabilities and stand with it as a counter-terrorism partner. Biden will also
                        continue to push for India’s place in the UN Security Council. </p>
                    <p>As regards to climate change, Biden administration will start working towards re-entering the
                        Paris Agreement, where India will lead in making headway towards a better future. In his
                        campaign, Biden promised to reverse the recent sanctions on Iran, which will lead to India
                        getting access to cheaper oil. Reversing these decisions of the Trump administration will
                        certainly reap remarkable benefits.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the current scenario, that of the global pandemic, Biden will certainly aid in the health
                        sector in the form of vaccinations, PPEs, medications, etc… India will have a key ally in the
                        USA - in pushing back against China, during a time when tensions between the two neighbours are
                        high.
                    </p>
                    <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">What this means for us? </h2> -->
                    <p>On the flip side, the Biden administration and the Modi government do not seem to share common
                        values, which may cause friction or apprehension due to future actions. Moreover, the proposed
                        H1-B visas based on wage allocation may not prove to be ideal for foreign students starting
                        entry-level jobs.
                    </p>
                    <p>When it comes to policies and politics, it’s likely that promises and wishes do not come true.
                        There are compromises and losses, but there are wins too. With the Biden government coming in
                        power on January 20,2021, one thing is guaranteed. India will see lots of mindful conversation
                        and participation with the US.
                    </p>
                    <p>All of these future plans and scenarios are plain speculation. What happens will be
                        circumstantial and much more complicated than just a few sentences. This US presidential
                        election is consequential not in mending and improving relations, rather in mending the
                        democratic values that sit at the core of both nations.
                    </p>
