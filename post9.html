                    <p>The concept of LGBTQ+ rights and same-sex unions is often regarded as a modern discussion. But this “concept” has a place in Indian history, and it’s astounding to note that such discussions were very much prevalent in India. However, before diving into the nitty-gritty of queer history in India, let’s have a look at some important terms.</p>
                    <p><strong>Know the words.</strong></p>
                    <p>Gender fluidity refers to change in a person’s gender expression and/or gender identity over time. Multiplicity means identifying oneself with multiple genders. Khwajasarais, Hijras, Aravanis are all colloquial terms used for males who identify themselves as females.</p>
                    <p><strong>What does our history say?</strong></p>
                    <p>The Bhakti movement was a revolution started by Hindu saints to bring religious reforms by adopting devotion to achieve salvation. During this movement, male saints would feminize themselves in order to worship Lord Krishna and Lord Shiva. Another similar instance would be that of the court of Awadh, where the Nawabs would dress themselves up as women on saint days of their Pirs during the birth of descendants. These traditions endured on till the 18th century, without being ridiculed, derided upon or seen as criminal offences. There existed a sort of nonchalance to differences in gender for thousands of years in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
                    <p>Instances from art and literature. Indian art and literature make several references to same-sex unions in the pre-modern era. The Kamasutra, written in 4th century AD, has a plethora of texts on male-male unions. It touches upon casual relationships, means of interaction and serious unions. Texts from 14th century Bengal regale a story of two women who have a sexual relationship and are divinely blessed. One of them gives birth to a hero named Bhagiratha – the one who brought the river Ganga down from heaven. This birth story, however, is found only in Bengal texts despite the popularity of Bhagirath across India. Interestingly, these texts also narrate the ordeal of a son of two mothers, something that is relatable and holds significance in the modern context. Urdu poetry mentions such unions too. Rekhti poetry is a feminist form of poetry from 19th century that openly discusses women’s mannerisms and sexuality. Some of these poems depict a sort of marriage between women. Rangin, one of the poets writing in this style, describes the rituals involved on such occasions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Colonial brainwashing and schooling.</strong></p>
                    <p>All the practices and traditions mentioned above appalled the British who entered India in the 18th century. Thomas Macaulay, a British politician, introduced Section 377 in Indian Penal Code, 1860. The British also passed the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871 that recognised entire communities as having criminal tendencies. Some of these communities included hijras and other transgender people. This severely restricted their movement and coerced them to make frequent visits to police stations for reporting. This Act was repealed in 1949.</p>
                    <p>However, remains of British intolerance remained even Post-Independence. This intolerance was reflected in the Hindu and Muslim personal laws as well. They drilled their opinions into the Indian culture by extensive schooling and education that encouraged even the loathing of our own ancient traditions. What was proudly accepted for centuries, was pushed into the shadows because of colonialism.</p>
                    <p><strong>Role of Indians in furthering colonial mindset.</strong></p>
                    <p>In order to augment India’s image on a global level, Indian nationalists and leaders adopted some conservative Victorian attitudes towards our own non-heteronormative traditions. This colonial brainwashing left such an indelible mark on Indian culture and laws that even after Britain legalized same-sex relations in 1967, Indians remained wary of homosexuality.</p>
                    <p>Since then, India has repealed Section 377. There has also been visibly wider acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community. But acceptance is simply a bridge to normality. India must unlearn the colonial dictums left behind and embrace not just homosexuality, but sexuality in general. Despite the efforts in the right direction, India has a long way to go. Indian history can become a guide to embracing the uniqueness of individuals, and believing that every individual has the right to be themselves.</p>
