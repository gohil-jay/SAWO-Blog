                    <p>What to do when you are locked up at home and can’t go out with friends to chill? Work is limited to the laptop; shopping is at one’s fingertips and in a couple of days we get anything and everything delivered at home! One can binge watch movies and TV shows with their friends, laying comfortably because entertainment just needs a gadget and an internet connection. With the transformation of technology, home entertainment on OTT Platforms is the new normal. 
                    </p>
                    <p>With extended lockdowns and the current economic scenario, even though 100% occupancy in multiplexes and cinema halls has been granted, this industry suffered heavily. It was one of the first to close and last to open. Additionally, there has been a considerable lack of new material as OTT platforms have snapped up all the new releases. This leaves Inox, PVR, Cinepolis, etc. to re-release old movies.  Although why would anyone wish to watch old films?
                    </p>
                    <p>Indian cinema is certainly one of the biggest across the world, with a massive number of movies being released annually. Apart from these, Sony TV, Zee, etc. also air a multitude of TV series. However, for the upcoming year, the traditional route for movies and TV series are not showing signs of hope. Trying to recover from the eye-watering losses of the previous year will be a task, especially now since OTT platforms have boomed at the same time. The emergence of OTT platforms has disrupted the entertainment sector. OTT (Over-the-top) services, which stream media online, have become prominent by broadcasting original TV shows and movies, besides live entertainment.  
                    </p>
                    <p>The film industry isn’t just the actors. It is so much more. It runs on technicians, light persons, videographers and cinematographers, assistants, etc. These individuals, who earned much less than actors, were out of jobs owing to the pandemic. OTT platforms gave them a chance to work and earn, just the same. Producers, too, shifted to OTT, as the big screens dimmed their limelights. 
                    </p>
                    <p>For the viewers, too, OTT platforms display merits aplenty. Affordability and convenience are the key factors that have propelled the OTT revolution in India. OTT sector has witnessed a 30% rise in subscribers in India. It has unbelievably disrupted the trend of watching on screens and going to multiplex. So, find the latest to watch, right at your place, every time and everywhere.
                        </p>
                    <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">What this means for us? </h2> -->
                    <p>The joy of watching films on large screens, however, can simply not be taken away. The pandemic seems to be a bump in the road of growth of the film industry. An expensive bump, though – costing nearly Rs 2,000 crores. The industry will jump back. Big screens and big names appeal to the Indian crowd more than any other. People enjoy going to the movies, eat popcorn and drink coke, and make a whole day out of it. There is no doubt about traditional cinema being around. The question that remains, however, is how it will adjust to the industry disruptor, that is OTT platforms.
