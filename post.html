                    <p>Genetically Modified Crops has been a hot topic of discussion and debate for world forums since
                        its advent. It has a series of disadvantages and advantages which puts us in a situation wherein
                        we are forced to choose the lesser of both evils. </p>
                    <p>Increasing human population is a matter of concern and has a lot of consequences on the
                        environment besides the obvious stress on natural resources to fulfil the ever-growing human
                        needs.
                        Genetically Modified Food is food produced by altering their DNA through the means of genetic
                        engineering. This process manipulates their natural traits and allows us to modify them in ways
                        which we desire. </p>
                    <p>Looking at the brighter side of GMOs let’s talk about its <b>positives</b>: <br><br>
                        1) It helps increase the yield of the seed which helps the farmer to increase his harvest per
                        acre and also earn more. <br>
                        2) By virtue of genetic engineering it makes the crop resistant to parasites, pests and
                        decreases its vulnerability of going bad. <br>
                        3) Genetic modifying can also help in changing the nutritional values. <br>
                        4) Genetic modification can also improve the visual appearance and size of the harvest which
                        makes it easy to market and fetch higher prices. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>There’s a broad scientific consensus that GMOs currently on the market pose no threat to human
                        health. But still the use of GMOs is a very controversial topic. There’s a chunk of people who
                        demand a tight check on the production and usage of these GMOs as most of them are patented by
                        large corporations or companies. </p>
                    <p>Looking at the flip side of GMOs let's take a glance on its <b>negatives</b>:<br><br>
                        1) Genetic modification increases the risk of disruption of the biodiversity and ecosystem
                        because the “better” trait produced by modifying genes can favour one organism. Hence, it can
                        disrupt the natural gene flow.<br>
                        2) There is always a constant threat lingering on human life due to modified or artificial
                        nutritional value. <br>
                        3) The transgenic crops not only endanger not only farmers but the trade, and the environment as
                        well. <br>
                        4) It results in increased price of cultivation and has an agenda of marketisation of farmed
                        goods <br>
                        5) The excessive production of genetically altered foods will be rendered ineffective over time
                        because the parasites that used to deter from these might develop resistance against them over
                        time <br>
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">What this means for us? </h2>
                    <p>GMOs are still to be deemed as a boon or a bane for humanity. Yet, the basic conscience forces us
                        to think whether altering the natural characteristics of food which has allowed us to thrive and
                        evolve for millions years is a healthy practice or not. But as Gandhi once said “The world has
                        enough for everyone’s need, but not for anyone’s greed”. A lot of environmentalists have
                        suggested that if we make small self sufficient food communities the soil can grow enough
                        natural food to sustain everyone.
                        “Innovations that are guided by smallholder farmers, adapted to local circumstances, and
                        sustainable for the economy and environment are going to be necessary to ensure food safety in
                        the future.”<br>
