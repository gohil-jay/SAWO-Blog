                    <p>Two decades of blood spilt political roulette played, and lives uprooted have ended in a fiasco. After the US forces nearly completed vacating Afghanistan, the Taliban shocked the world with the country’s annexation much earlier than the US Army’s estimation. This takeover shall have repercussions, not just for India but the whole world.</p>
                    <p>India has maintained a strong connection with the local ties in Afghanistan throughout the turmoil of the past few years. India believes that the peace process must be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled. However, India’s voice hasn’t had much gravity, as Russia, China and Pakistan continue to reject the possibility of India as a vital participant in the ongoing talks. Indian interests have mainly lain in building the infrastructure in Afghanistan, including 200 schools, highways and the coveted Shahtoot Dam that will provide safe drinking water to the people of Kabul. India has invested more than $3 billion in infrastructure projects in Afghanistan. The current bedlam and violence have put all such development in jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>India has been wary of the Taliban and has refrained from opening talks with them in the past. The reluctance persists even though a shift in policy is slowly coming around. As the Taliban moves towards becoming the official government, India must engage in dialogue with the Taliban. Its dominance in Afghanistan raises security and economic concerns for India. India needs to ensure that the Taliban, cosy with Pakistan, doesn’t propagate terrorism in J&K. Pakistan has been aiding Taliban in the hope of gaining more leverage in the region. However, this proximity will cost Pakistan its goal of coming out of the FATF grey list that incriminates the country for terror funding. Afghanistan is lucrative for connectivity to Central Asia as well, thus augmenting its economic value for India. The recent ban on exports and imports between Afghanistan and India gives more impetus to the fact that the Taliban rule is economically disadvantageous too.</p>
                    <p>The power vacuum that has been created after the US withdrawal could well be filled by China, which is not sitting idle. China was amongst the first countries to officially hold discussions with the political brass of the Taliban. Its interests in Afghanistan are moving from solely economic to strategic and military. China could have Afghanistan as a major strategic base for connections to both South and West Asia. It has proposed an extension of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project to Afghanistan. Adding Afghanistan to its power hold would strengthen its position in the region as Pakistan and Iran are already allies. This could help paint a fiercer portrait of the country on a global level. All of these factors are not palatable for India.</p>
                    <p>The conclusion to the play in Afghanistan is neither close nor easy. As diplomatic relations stand on shaky grounds, India requires a three-pronged policy to tackle the Taliban’s motives, China’s influence and Pakistan’s consequential gain. How the situation unfolds in the coming months remains to be seen.</p>
                    <p>What has happened in Afghanistan is a stamped failure of humanity as a whole. As a nation with consistent humanitarian policy-making, India must contribute to nudging Afghanistan away from this painful agony. Our prayers are with the people of Afghanistan.</p>
