                    <p>On 27 September 2020, the President of India gave assent to three controversial agricultural bills passed by the Centre in the monsoon session of the Parliament. These bills include the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, the Farmers; (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Prise Assurance and Farm Services Bill, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. Together, these three bills aim to enable private players to invest in agri-food supply chains, with passing of benefits to farmers in the form of higher returns, better input prices, higher technology and even training. They also allow farmers to approach and be approached by the private sector for sale of their product. 
                    </p>
                    <p>However, the following months have resulted in massive protests by farmers hailing mainly from several states, and gathering at the capital, New Delhi. Protesting farmers display that these bills will lead to the calculated removal of MSP and takeover by the private sector. The government has repeatedly assured them that these bills have no impact on the workings and regulation of MSP, which will prevail just the same, and that the entry of the private sector is to boost much-needed development of the agricultural sector. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The farmers demanded a complete repealing of all three laws, to which the government blatantly portrayed refusal. However, any number of sittings and talks of various unions with different governmental individuals and entities have been inconclusive. Both sides are stern on their position. The farmers are hostile and the government is purposive. Thus, the protests have continued. On the 72nd Republic Day, farmers even carried out a tractor rally, causing significant disturbance on this auspicious day.                     </p>
                    <p>On 12 January 2021, the Supreme Court issued a stay on the implementation of the farm laws and set up a committee to look at the bills. Even with this action, there are certain troubles, including the pro farm bills nature of the committee and the refusal of the farmers to accept said committee. This decision of the court also violates the salient feature of separation of powers. The set-up committee is to submit a report two months later, which will be the result of carefully navigated talks between the farmers and the government. 
                    </p>
                    <p>In our democracy, largely run by this hand that feeds, the government must listen. But by giving in to their demands without considerable thought and action sets a dangerous precedent for the future, wherein any group might do the same. Will the farmers and the Central government meet a consensus?
