                    <p>As the global pandemic changes the way we interact with our surroundings, the human quest for progressing and fostering finds innovative ways of living life as usual.</p>
                    <p>People from different walks of life have been affected differently and this situation demands them to alter the way of their working professionally too.</p>
                    <p>Lately, the concept of “education from home” or “learning from home” has seen a sudden surge, it has emerged as the most obvious solution for students to keep up with their studies and teachers to teach students. A lot of softwares and IT tools have mushroomed in the past 10 months since the pandemic began.</p>
                    <p>This concept may be new to a lot of countries but others have been using it for a long time. As a result, some countries are better equipped in terms of infrastructure required for e-learning as compared to other countries.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
                    <p>The advantages of E-learning are manifold it not only helps the students in seamlessly attending their class despite the fact that physical presence on the campus is suspended. By the virtue of online classes, a significant amount of time is saved as it cuts down the travel time. Both, students and teachers can attend and conduct classes respectively, from the convenience and safety of their own home. Numerous softwares which are available, enable the students to record the lectures which helps them to revisit the classes in the future if need be.</p>
                    <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
                    <p>The concept of E-learning also comes with its own set of disadvantages. A lot of programmes taught at schools and universities are designed to be taught with direct and in person interaction of the student and the teacher, which is not possible in this scenario. The facilitation of online classes demands certain resources and infrastructure, which not all educational institutions are equipped with. Students who belong to less privileged backgrounds might not have access to laptops or phones capable of running such softwares, they might also not have access to data connections, all of these are prerequisites for online classes. Additionally, smooth running of online classes depends on a variety of actors such as uninterrupted electricity supply, data connections and so on, the absence of any of these factors make it very difficult to conduct or attend these classes.</p>
                    <p>These are just a few direct advantages and disadvantages. The way humans exist, there are an array of other factors which affect us:</p>
                    <p><i><strong>Absence of Social Gathering: </strong> As people are confined to their homes, it limits their social interaction which results in irritation, loneliness and in some extreme cases, might result in anxiety.</i></p>
                    <p><i><strong>Lack of Physical Activity: </strong> As we are unable to move freely the activity that we involuntarily do has stopped and hence we have to make a conscious effort to even do the bare minimum.</i></p>
                    <p><i>Also, the sheer lack of variety in environments results in monotony.</i></p>
                    <p>In conclusion, we must be aware of the changes that the situation demands and adapt to it in a healthy manner. We should also strive to make new innovations that make it easier, accessible, healthy and convenient to everyone. As they say <strong>“THE STARTING OF ALL ACHIEVEMENT IS DESIRE”</strong></p>
