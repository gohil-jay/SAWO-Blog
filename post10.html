                    <p><strong>“The only constant in technology industry is change”.</strong></p>
                    <p><i>Information Technology Laws</i>, popularly referred to as <i>Cyber Laws</i> concern the laws regarding IT, including digital devices like computers and smartphones, and the internet. These laws focus on issues like privacy and data protection. They are not about mere protection from cybercrimes, but also about ensuring the safety of the data of billions of individuals online and ensuring that no illegal activities take place. In February 2021, the <i>new IT Laws</i> were released by the <i>Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)</i> of India, whereby all social media intermediaries and OTT platforms were given 3 months to comply with the laws. And on 26th May 2021, the government sought the status of compliance with the new rules which went into effect from that day onwards.</p>
                    <p>The IT Rules, 2021 plan to enable conventional clients of web-based media stages and OTT platforms with a system for redressal and the assistance of a Grievance Redressal Officer (GRO) who ought to be an inhabitant of India. Unique accentuation has been given for the safety of ladies and youngsters from sexual offences, counterfeit news and other abuse on social media.</p>
                    <p>Companies like Google, Facebook and Telegram shared their detailed reports with the Ministry as per the new regulations, while <i>Twitter</i> sought an extension and called for a constructive dialogue with a collaborative approach from the government to safeguard the freedom of speech of the public. <i>WhatsApp</i> filed a case against the government in <i>Delhi High Court</i> in the context of the new rules violating its user policies, while newspapers like <i>The Wire</i> and <i>The Quint</i> also challenged this <i>Digital Ethics Code</i>.</p>
                    <p>The positive side of the laws is that the government can check on unlawful activities like child abuse, sexual abuse and corner the guilty easily by encrypting their details. It means the negative content shared online will be noticed by the government. In case of non-compliance, the intermediary will lose its safe harbour from user content, thus making it liable to punishment under any law. However, with the good comes the bad, and these laws make no exemption. The provision of having one’s personal conversations and profiles under a microscope is against an individual’s Right to Privacy, as per Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal will have to lower their strong end-to-end encryption levels to allow verifiability under the laws. The major drawback is that it will breach the privacy of users, something that is very fundamental.</p>
                    <p>As far as other social media companies are concerned, Facebook has confirmed that “they aim to comply with the provisions of the IT Laws, even as they continue to discuss some matters with the government", while Twitter has yet to give out any comments. India is a massive market for these significant social media intermediaries and it now remains to be seen how the entities will decide to proceed, especially after WhatsApp's lawsuit against the Government of India. After implementing the new IT Laws, live streaming content on social media has undergone promising changes. The rules have become the strictest for all other domains.</p>
                    <p>There is no single, undivided viewpoint on this. Even though the IT Laws may jeopardize data privacy, they also ensure the safety and security of the people of India. These laws will save the citizens from falling into any sort of internet trap and help them more in increasing their knowledge.</p>
